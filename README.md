# DEAD SIGNAL: EXCLUSION ZONE

*The Claude Opus 5.5 Zombies Game* — built end-to-end by Claude Opus 5.5 in Claude Code from a single prompt.

A single-player, browser-based first-person extraction-survival shooter built with Three.js, TypeScript and Vite.
Insert into a quarantined industrial district at blue hour, complete two contracts, upgrade your gear, then signal a
helicopter and survive the final horde long enough to board it — before the contamination front reaches the LZ.

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://127.0.0.1:5173
pnpm build        # typecheck + production build into dist/
pnpm preview      # serve the production build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test         # vitest unit tests for the pure game logic
```

Requires a desktop browser with WebGL and pointer lock (current Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari). No backend or accounts.

## Controls

| Key | Action | Key | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WASD | Move | E | Interact |
| Mouse | Look | 1 / 2, wheel | Switch weapon |
| LMB / RMB | Fire / aim down sights | G | Frag grenade |
| R | Reload | Q | Apply armor plate |
| Shift | Sprint | M (or Tab) | Tactical map |
| Space / C | Jump / crouch (toggle) | Esc | Pause and release the mouse |

At a Quartermaster station or the Armory bench, press **E** to open it and a **number key (3–6)** to buy.

## The mission (~8–10 minutes)

1. **Defend the Uplink Relay** (Kessler Depot, medium threat): activate it, then stay inside the ring for 60 s. Progress only
   builds while you are in the zone and slowly decays when you leave.
2. **Hunt WARDEN-9** (Halcyon Compound, high threat): a large armored elite. Shoot the helmet off, then go for the head.
3. **Extract**: once both contracts are done, the contamination front starts spreading from the reactor and the timer
   clamps to a 5:30 exfil window. Signal RAVEN 2-1 at the LZ radio, hold for 75 s while the final horde comes in, then walk
   to the helicopter door and press E. Dying, or running out of time, fails the mission.

Threat regions change zombie composition (runners and armored infected become common further north), health, damage and
salvage rewards. Supply caches in higher-threat areas hold better loot.

## Development test mode

`pnpm dev` then open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/?dev` to expose `window.__DS` automation hooks (teleport, synthetic input,
time scale, spawn helpers). They drive the real systems and are only compiled into dev builds — the production bundle
contains none of it.

## Assets and attribution

Everything is generated at runtime: textures (canvas noise, normal maps from height fields), meshes (primitives merged and
instanced), zombie skinned meshes, signage, and all audio (WebAudio synthesis). No third-party art or sound files are used.
Fonts come from the local system stack. Three.js is MIT licensed.
